                This book was the main reason I got into murder mystery. 
                I used to only read realistic fiction and fantasy before, but when a lot of friends recommended me to read this book, I decided to give it a try.
                The setup of the story was super interesting, and I thought it was the perfect combination of thrilling while being realistic. <br>
                <br>But I feel like what really set apart this murder mystery series from the other interesting mystery books I have read is the progression of the main character Pip.
                Over the series, you can really see that because of the traumatizing things Pip faces, she changes. 
                The ending of the last book was pretty contraversial but I think it makes a lot of sense. 
                A lot of mystery books don't really show how traumatizing the experience is for the main character, and how it impacts them for the rest of their life, so I thought that this book was a breath of fresh air since it showed her mental breakdown.<br>
                <br> Overall, I would really recommend you to read this series! Even if you aren't a mystery or thriller person, you would still enjoy this!
