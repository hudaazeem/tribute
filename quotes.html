            <p>
                <i>“What's wrong with me? ... I might seem like the ideal student: homework always in early, every extra credit and extra curricular I can get my hands on, the good girl and the high achiever. 
                    But I realized something just now: it's not ambition, not entirely. It's fear. Because I don't know who I am when I'm not working, when I'm not focused on or totally consumed by a task. 
                    Who am I between the projects and the assignments, when there's nothing to do? I haven't found her yet and it scares me. Maybe that's why, for my senior capstone project this year, 
                    I decided to solve a murder.”</i>

                <i>"She hadn't almost lost herself, maybe she'd actually been meeting herself for the very first time. 
                    And she was tired of feeling guilty about it. Tired of feeling shame about who she was."</i>

                <i>“The truth doesn’t matter,’ Pip said, digging her nails into her thigh. The Pip from last year wouldn't recognize this one today. 
                    That lively-eyed girl and her school project, naïvely clinging to the truth, wrapping it around herself like a blanket. 
                    But the Pip sitting here was a different person and she knew better. 
                    The truth had burned her too many times; it couldn't be trusted.”</i>
