                <h2>Book 1 - A Good Girl's Guide to Murder</h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone in Fairview knows the story. <br> 
                    <br>Pretty and popular high school senior Andie Bell was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh, who then killed himself. 
                    It was all anyone could talk about. 
                    And five years later, Pip sees how the tragedy still haunts her town. <br>
                    <br>But she can't shake the feeling that there was more to what happened that day. 
                    She knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. 
                    How could he possibly have been a killer? <br>
                    <br>Now a senior herself, Pip decides to reexamine the closed case for her final project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation. 
                    But soon she discovers a trail of dark secrets that might actually prove Sal innocent... and the line between past and present begins to blur. 
                    Someone in Fairview doesn't want Pip digging around for answers, and now her own life might be in danger.

                <h2>Book 2 - Good Girl, Bad Blood</h2>
                <p>
                    <br>Pip is not a detective anymore.<br>
                    <br>With the help of Ravi Singh, she released a true-crime podcast about the murder case they solved together last year. 
                    The podcast has gone viral, yet Pip insists her investigating days are behind her. <br>
                    <br>But she will have to break that promise when someone she knows goes missing. 
                    Jamie Reynolds has disappeared, on the very same night the town hosted a memorial for the sixth-year anniversary of the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh.<br>
                    <br>The police won't do anything about it. And if they won't look for Jamie then Pip will, uncovering more of her town's dark secrets along the way... and this time everyone is listening. 
                    But will she find him before it's too late?

                <h2>Book 3 - As Good As Dead</h2>
                <p>
                    Pip is about to head to college, but she is still haunted by the way her last investigation ended. 
                    She’s used to online death threats in the wake of her viral true-crime podcast, but she can’t help noticing an anonymous person who keeps asking her: 
                    Who will look for you when you’re the one who disappears?<br>
                    <br> Soon the threats escalate and Pip realizes that someone is following her in real life. 
                    When she starts to find connections between her stalker and a local serial killer caught six years ago, she wonders if maybe the wrong man is behind bars.<br>
                    <br> Police refuse to act, so Pip has only one choice: find the suspect herself—or be the next victim. As the deadly game plays out, 
                    Pip discovers that everything in her small town is coming full circle... and if she doesn’t find the answers, 
                    this time she will be the one who disappears...

                    Pippa Fitz-Amobi is not in the mood for her friend's murder mystery party. 
                    Especially one that involves 1920's fancy dress and pretending that their town, Little Kilton, is an island called Joy.

                    But as Pip plays detective, teasing out the identity of the killer clue-by-clue, the murder of the fictional Reginald Remy isn't the only case on her mind...
