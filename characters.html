                <h2>Pippa (Pip) Fitz-Amobi</h2>
                <p>
                    The protagonist of the series. She is 17 years old and grew up in Little Kilton, the same small town that was consumed by the murder of Sal Singh and Andie Bell. 
                    She is loyal, intelligent, and remains calm under pressure, always striving to do what's right. 
                    She is often willing to take extreme measures to seek justice, a trait that develops throughout the series. 
                    In the first book, she decides to investigate the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh for her EPQ project at school. 
                    With the help of Sal's younger brother, Ravi Singh, they both seek clues to uncover the dark secrets of their seemingly innocent town.

                <h2>Andie Bell</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the victims of the tragic murder-suicide that rocked Little Kilton. 
                    She was popular at school, with a penchant for drama and a tendency to be two-faced. 
                    She could be charming and make people feel special, but also used their vulnerabilities against them. 
                    She had many secrets that Pip would discover throughout the series. She was in a relationship with Sal Singh, and everyone suspects it was he who killed her.
