                <ul>
                    <li><u>Pippa "Pip" Fitz-Amobi:</u>Pip is a bright and curious high school senior known for her intelligence, determination, and strong moral compass. 
                        She decides to investigate a closed murder case for her school project, driven by a gut feeling that the town's accepted story doesn't add up. 
                        (there is more info about the reason to investigate the murders in the prequel). 
                        Her tenacity often puts her at odds with people who would prefer the past stay buried.
                    </li><br>
                    <br><li><u>Andie Bell:</u> Andie was a popular and enigmatic student at Pip's school before her sudden disappearance rocked the town. 
                        The town believes her boyfriend, Sal Singh, killed her.
                        She came from a privileged family and was known for her beauty and charm, though as Pip discovers, she had a lot of secrets and enemies. 
                    </li><br>
                    <br><li><u>Sal Singh:</u>Sal was a kind and well-liked student who had a bright future ahead of him. 
                        He was Andie's boyfriend, and really cared about her. Allegedly, he first killed Andie and then killed himself.
                        After this, he became a figure surrounded by controversy and speculation. 
                        His memory is often discussed with mixed emotions in Little Kilton.
                    </li><br>
                    <br><li><u>Ravi Singh:</u>Ravi is Sal's younger brother, thoughtful and a bit guarded due to the way his family was treated after the tragedy. 
                        After Pip asks for his help in clearing his brother's name, he becomes an unlikely but crucial ally to Pip in her investigation. 
                        Despite everything, he retains a sharp sense of humor and a deep loyalty to his brother.
