# AGGGTM Tribute Website

### What my project is:
This is a website dedicated to the book A Good Girl's Guide to Murder. It has the descriptions of each of the books, a list of the most important characters, a compilation of my favorite quotes, a description of the author, my review of the whole series, and links to other websites that are helpful (such as Goodreads, the Wiki, Amazon, and Storygraph).

### Why I made this project:
I decided to make this project based on the Tribute YSWS made by the Athena Initiative. In that YSWS, we have to make a static website dedicated to one topic or item we are passionate about. Since this book series is my favorite, I decided to make a dedicated website about it.

### How I made my project:
I used HTML and CSS to make my project, although I did have to use minimal JS to make the buttons work. I wrote my code on GitHub Codespaces and am hosting my website on GitHub Codespaces. With help for certain website features, I used W3Schools as a reference.

### What I struggled with:
I added more advanced features to this website than in previous projects, such as a navbar. It was challenging at first to incorporate these things, and I had to troubleshoot a lot. Also, I messed up while making branches and committing my code, so that was also a struggle to fix. 

### What I learned:
After this project, I can make a basic static website on my own with minimal help. This project really helped me improve my HTML and CSS skills, and now I feel confident in front-end web development.
